            <b>ABSTRACT: </b>
            SDU-Haier-AQD (Shandong University-Haier-Appearance Quality Detection) is an image dataset jointly constructed
            by Shandong University and Haier, which contains a various of air conditioner external unit image collected
            during actual detection process.The Appearance Quality Detection (AQD) dataset is consisted of 10449 images, and
            the samples in the dataset are collected on the actual industrial production line of air conditioner. We
            selected 11 typical models, marked the typical appearance feature (Brand logo, Connector pipe head and Air
            outlet net cover), and divided the feature into 16 labels.

            <b>Instructions: </b>
            The images in the dataset are uniformly in jpg format, and the image size is 2464×2056 or 1232×1028. All the
            labels are saved as .xml files. It contains the size of the image, the name and location of the different
            labels.

            <b>ABSTRACT: </b>
            SDU-Haier-ND (Shandong University-Haier-Noise Detection) is a sound dataset jointly constructed by Shandong
            University and Haier, which contains the operating sound of the internal air conditioner collected during the
            product quality inspection. We collected and marked a batch of quality inspection sounds of air conditioners in
            real production environments to form this data set, including normal sound samples and abnormal sound samples.
            The data set contains a variety of abnormal sounds, covering a variety of common failures of air conditioners,
            such as abnormalities caused by bearings or guide plates.

            <b>Instructions: </b>
            SDU-Haier-ND dataset contains a total of 536 sound samples in wav format, and the sampling frequency of the
            sound signal is 48kHz. The sound samples are collected manually, so the sound duration is not the same. The
            valid sound signal, that is, the operating sound of the air conditioner, is collected in a confined space called
            the sound room to isolate other sounds in the production workshop. The doors of the sound room are open before
            and after the air conditioning detection. At this time, the radio equipment in the noise room will collect
            various sounds from the production workshop, so the sound samples in this dataset contain some invalid noise.

        <b>ABSTRACT: </b>
        A dataset asscociated with paper “Learning-based Sparse Data Reconstruction for Compressed Data Aggregation in IoT
        Networks” in IEEE Internet of Things Journal. Five different structured sparse models (SSMs) are considered in the
        synthesized dataset, including random sparse (Sparse Model A), row sparse (Sparse Model B), row-sparse with embedded
        element-sparse (Sparse Model C), row-sparse plus element-spares (Sparse Model D) and block diagonal sparse (Block Sparse
        or group sparse).
