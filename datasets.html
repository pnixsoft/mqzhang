            SDU-Haier-AQD (Shandong University-Haier-Appearance Quality Detection) is an image dataset jointly constructed
            by Shandong University and Haier, which contains a various of air conditioner external unit image collected
            during actual detection process.The Appearance Quality Detection (AQD) dataset is consisted of 10449 images, and
            the samples in the dataset are collected on the actual industrial production line of air conditioner. We
            selected 11 typical models, marked the typical appearance feature (Brand logo, Connector pipe head and Air
            outlet net cover), and divided the feature into 16 labels.

            <b>ABSTRACT: </b>
            SDU-Haier-ND (Shandong University-Haier-Noise Detection) is a sound dataset jointly constructed by Shandong
            University and Haier, which contains the operating sound of the internal air conditioner collected during the
            product quality inspection. We collected and marked a batch of quality inspection sounds of air conditioners in
            real production environments to form this data set, including normal sound samples and abnormal sound samples.
            The data set contains a variety of abnormal sounds, covering a variety of common failures of air conditioners,
            such as abnormalities caused by bearings or guide plates.

            <b>Instructions: </b>
            SDU-Haier-ND dataset contains a total of 536 sound samples in wav format, and the sampling frequency of the
            sound signal is 48kHz. The sound samples are collected manually, so the sound duration is not the same. The
            valid sound signal, that is, the operating sound of the air conditioner, is collected in a confined space called
            the sound room to isolate other sounds in the production workshop. The doors of the sound room are open before
            and after the air conditioning detection. At this time, the radio equipment in the noise room will collect
            various sounds from the production workshop, so the sound samples in this dataset contain some invalid noise.

        <b>ABSTRACT: </b>
        A dataset asscociated with paper “Learning-based Sparse Data Reconstruction for Compressed Data Aggregation in IoT
        Networks” in IEEE Internet of Things Journal. Five different structured sparse models (SSMs) are considered in the
        synthesized dataset, including random sparse (Sparse Model A), row sparse (Sparse Model B), row-sparse with embedded
        element-sparse (Sparse Model C), row-sparse plus element-sparse (Sparse Model D) and block diagonal sparse (Block Sparse
        or group sparse).

<b>ABSTRACT: </b>
The Prognostic/ Predictive Health Monitoring (PHM) and Fault diagnosis of milling cutters are key issue in the field of machine tool manufacturing. As the "teeth" of CNC machine tools, their health status directly affects the machining efficiency and the quality of products. It has become a hot topic in both academic research and industries, which propose to employ big data and deep learning technology to realize high reliable tool fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance. However, the lack of high-quality yet life-cycle data has become the bottleneck restricting academic research and engineering promotion.

Supported by the Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Shandong Province "R&D and application demonstration of key technologies for new adaptive production systems in the field of machine tool manufacturing", the research team of Shandong University cooperated with Qilu Institute of Technology to jointly setup a multi-sensor based data colloection platform on the machining tools.

At present, the datasets is complete run-to-fault data of 6 end mill.Datasets is open, and it is verified that the tool prediction algorithm of CNC machining tools can be used by anyone.
